                    After fixing some mild bugs in the algorithm, and creating a safeDelete method for inconsistencyCases, the Consistency Check Algorithm is now stable!

                    Finished vetting and dry testing algorithm for consistency checking, beginning to actually
                    write the code for it, and building it into the ProductDB Stock Handler.

                <p>
                    Some flaws in the current v2 consistency check system have incentivised me to update the logic to better function under
                    current conditions. This also gives me an opportunity to potentially multi-thread the entire consistency check system, allowing
                    me to make it a lot faster and more efficient.

                <p>
                    Platforms that utilise webhooks to notify us of stock changes will roughly 50% of the time take too long to
                    send the stock change. This results in consistency checks picking up consistency problems and having issues.
